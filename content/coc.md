## Be nice to each other

We trust that members will treat each other in a way that reflects the widely held view that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our community to be celebrated and fostered.

Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:

- be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or bullying;
- enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.

## Don’t spam

We would like to encourage networking and dance related discussions, as well as keep conversation meaningful and interesting for everyone. Please see [FAQ section about ads](/faq).
