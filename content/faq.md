#### Q: Can I write a private message to everyone in the chat?

Being in a group doesn't entitle anybody to send messages privately to anybody else, except on invitation (like "pls pm me about this exact subject") and for specific subject of common interest between both parties (for example participating in a poll).

Users writing non-dance private messages should be reported to admins and will be instantly banned. See below.

#### Q: I am getting some weird messages on Telegram after I joined WeDance, what should I do?

1. Make a screenshot of chat with this user.
2. Make screenshot of the profile of that user.
3. Check which groups in common you have with this user.
4. If you see you have WeDanceMunich in common – send both screenshots to admins. They will ban this person from the chat.
5. Click "Block User" and they won't be able to write you anymore and Telegram will restrict rights to this user to contact strangers.
6. If you already blocked some users you can still find them under **Settings - Privacy - Blocked users**.

#### Q: How to stop unknown numbers sending me messages on Telegram?

Basics first — "People can contact you on Telegram through two ways: Your phone number and/or your Telegram username.

Unknown numbers are presumably numbers of those people who you don't know - strangers. These people can contact you ONLY through your Telegram username. They can't see your phone number. Telegram makes sure that you get justice. So, if you tap on their profile info, and if you don't see their number, then they can't see your number too.

So a solution to avoid it is to remove your Telegram username, if you have set one. But if you need a username then set such a username that people won't usually think to search for. e.g. iridino97

What these people do is, they search names of people in the Telegram global search and then message random people.

Though, when such a random person messages you, a message pops up at the top: Report Spam. You can tap on it.

Another way people can contact you is when they see your name in any public group. If such a case happens, then you can tag them in the group and tell not to message in one to one conversation or tell the administrator about it.

#### Q: Who can see my phone number?

On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible. By default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts. You can further modify this in **Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number**.

Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and **saved** it in their address book. [Source Telegram FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq)

#### Q: What ads are allowed in the group?

Ads and news about dance events are welcomed, but should be as short as possible.

Your ad can contain only:

- title (max 50 symbols)
- date and time of the event
- link with more information: how to contact organiser, how to register, rules, etc.
- max. 3 hashtags #salsa #bachata #kizomba #zouk #danchehall #tango so people can navigate between news faster
