# About WeDance

WeDance is a closed social network for dancers and non-profit international dance community.

**Our mission** is to unite dancers worldwide, so that you can go to any city and find dance events and dancers. It all starts with the local community and volunteers.

**Our platform** is closed social network [wedance.vip](https://wedance.vip/) is where every dancer can create a profile, recommend dance events and get advice. It is like Facebook, but we are not selling data. It is like Couchsurfing, but focusing on needs of dancers. We provide contact book of dancers in every city. Later we'll be focusing on maintaining a global dance calendar all together.

**Our community** is gathering in local city chats on Telegram. Our chats are something like train station, where different dance groups come together to help each other. It starts slowly, but even having one dance contact in your city will make a difference for a traveling dancer!

We have social media accounts like Instagram, Facebook, Telegram in every city and help dancers to connect and help organisers to promote their events.

We run different initiatives to spread dancing worldwide: we do podcasts and YouTube interviews with dance instructors, DJs and dancers to provide a platform where ideas can be heard and discussions started.

Our strategy think globally, act locally. It all starts with the local community.

We are dancers, we set an example for society, which neither religion, nor goverment, nor science can do.

We are building a society where each person is a brother or a sister, a friend and is ready to help. Here you can get help and help others, we love everyone who is with us. It's difficult to get inside, but when you get inside, you get warmth and care. We have a strict security guards, we create a safe place where it is cozy, warm and comfortable. Where you can know what is happening and when, with whom you can meet to dance, to go to the festival.

We do not like violence, bullying, humiliation, advertising, pornography and spam. We are creative, delicate, fragile natures. We have limits, and in this regard, everything is very strict. Reputation is above all, do not poop into the well from which you drink tomorrow. Respect your brothers and sisters, them and their culture and history. Look for a common language and reconciliation, ways to achieve a win-win situation. We have a boomerang principle (have you watched the Pay forward movie?) - help without remorse and it will return, we are not looking for self-interest.

We inspire, it's easy with us. It’s free and [open souce](https://github.com/we-dance/platform).
