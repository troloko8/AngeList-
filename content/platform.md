## Pure

Dance networking is getting messy in social networks. It's rather a sensitive topic and not always you want to share your passion with your friends, family and colleagues and want to keep it separate. Also it's difficult to find dance related topics out of spam, cats pictures and ads. We aim to quality content.

## Simple

All-in-one social networks are getting banned or blocked in different countries.

## Inspirational

Dance community lack creators, who would contribute blog posts, videos, podcasts, illustrations. But among dancers we have a lot of different experts in those fields. We enable creators to inspire dancing by providing technical online support and tools.

## Alternative social network for dancers

So as a dancer you don't need additional account in Facebook to connect with other dancers and be on heartbeat of dance life in your city. Neither you need to blow off your personal account with spam, when you joining hundreds of dance groups in Facebook and spam chats in Whatsapp.

Provide communication platform to announce events, build plans with dancers, share ideas of upcoming activities, find and connect with other dancers, share your progress, find answer to your question.

For this introduce City Chats which has a principle of SnapChat/Instagram Stories. You post a story, which will be active for one day. If your story gets enough attention it will get its way to Week, Month, Year highlights. Your story can get promoted by moderator to International and appear in all cities.
